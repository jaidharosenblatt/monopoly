# PROJECT PLAN


Write your plan for how to manage and prioritize the project in a single file, PROJECT_PLAN.md, that describes the APIs each team member plans to take primary and secondary responsibility for and a rough timeline of how the team will order the work to complete the program. Specifically, each person should take responsibility for specific features and use cases they intend to work on during each Sprint. This requires the team to agree on the feature priorities and set goals for what to complete at the end of each Sprint (i.e., each week).
